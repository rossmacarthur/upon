//! A builder for an Aho-Corasick automaton.
//!
//! From the given set of patterns we build a state machine with a series of
//! states that encode a transition for every possible byte. This state machine
//! can then used to simultaneously search a string for the patterns.
//!
//! Consider building an Aho-Corasick automaton with the following patterns:
//! 'ab' and 'cd', the trie would look the following. Where the states are
//! represented as `S?` and have an asterisk (`*`) if there any matches at that
//! state.
//!
//! ```text
//!      a - S1 - b - S2*
//!     /
//! S0 - c - S3 - d - S4*
//! ```
//!
//! In the above state machine there are no bytes that are the same between the
//! patterns. Now consider the following patterns: 'abe' and 'bcd'. In the case
//! of an input text of 'abcd', when at S2 we would end up failing to transition
//! to S3. But we can encode the failure in the automaton as a transition from
//! S2 to S4 and continue the search. What is not shown in these diagrams is that
//! *all* states have a failure transition, but only S2 has a *non-trivial*
//! failure transition. That is, all other states have a failure transition back
//! to the start state.
//!
//! ```text
//!      a - S1 - b - S2 - e - S3*
//!     /             /
//!    /       -------
//!   /       /
//! S0 - b - S4 - c - S5 - d - S6*
//! ```
//!
//! Encoding the failure transitions is the most complex part of building the
//! automaton. Traditionally, this is implemented using a breadth-first search
//! starting with all transitions from the start state. For each state and for
//! every input transition at that state we follow the failure transitions
//! backward until we find a failure state that has a forward transition for
//! that input. That state must be the fail state for the original state.
//!
//! In order to support leftmost-longest match first semantics we also need
//! to make a few modifications to the way the failure transitions are built.
